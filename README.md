# Impact of Weather Events on Population Health and Economic Losses

## An Analysis of NOAA's Storm Events Database

### This is a course assignment for Reproducible Research, Data Science Specialization by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. 
This report provides an analysis as to which weather events effect both aspects across the United States. 
It was found that “heat” related events have caused the most fatalities, followed by “tornado” and “flood” related events. 
“Flash flood” had the highest occurrences among the top 5 fatality events. 
In respect of economic losses, it was found that “flood” events have caused the most property damage, followed by “hurricane/typhoon”. 
“Drought” events, on the other hand, have caused the most crop damage, followed by “flood”. 
However, it was observed that the property damage caused by flood was significantly higher than hurricane/typhoon. 
Considering the recent events such as Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Katrina, a further investigation would be necessary to see if any recording errors have occurred.

The NOAA’s storm events database collected records from 1950 to 2011. Due to lack of diverse event types, records prior to 1993 were excluded in this analysis.
